# Final Project Intro to Web Development Class

## Description

- For this project I am going to build a multiplayer game using a C# API. I am going to create an online Pokémon battle simulator where players can create their team, customize it, and then battle other players with it.

- The user will be able to create an account to be able to save teams and matches. Once the user creates an account, they will have the possibility of creating a team of six Pokémon. The Pokémon information can be accessed through the Pokémon API. Then after selecting the team, the user can add items and moves to that Pokémon and customize their team. Finally, there will be a battle stage where the user can select either a single battle or a double battle and connect with another player to combat with their teams. It would be like a normal Pokémon battle with abilities, moves that deal different types of damage according to the types, special movements that lower stats, and many others. The site will have special features like creating multiple teams, being able to save them to memory, being able to look at match history, users being able to look at other matches, and there will be a ranking. 

- I wanted to build this project because I really like game development, and I also really like Pokémon, so it would be a way to combine both. I think it is a great way to show all the contents learned in this course and apply many of the "hard things" challenges. I think this project will help me develop my skills and learn many others, so that is why I chose it.
